            <p>LANGLEY,VA- A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence with black highliters.</p>
            <p>According to the report, sections of the documents-"almost invariably the most crucial passages"-are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read,</p>
            <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamenated the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the Cold War</li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            </ul>
